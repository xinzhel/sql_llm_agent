Here are ten SQL template examples for the given schema:

```SQL
1. SELECT Name FROM Company WHERE CompanyID = [Company.CompanyID];
2. SELECT Name, Location FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeID = [Employee.EmployeeID];
3. SELECT Name, Status FROM Project WHERE ProjectID = [Project.ProjectID];
4. SELECT Name FROM Capability WHERE CapabilityID = [Capability.CapabilityID];
5. SELECT Role FROM Project_Employee WHERE EmployeeID = [Project_Employee.EmployeeID] AND ProjectID = [Project_Employee.ProjectID];
6. SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) FROM Employee WHERE Location = [Employee.Location];
7. SELECT DISTINCT(Name) FROM Employee WHERE JobTitle = [Employee.JobTitle];
8. SELECT CompanyID, COUNT(ProjectID) FROM Company_Project WHERE CompanyID = [Company_Project.CompanyID] GROUP BY CompanyID;
9. SELECT ProjectID, COUNT(CapabilityID) FROM Project_Capability WHERE ProjectID = [Project_Capability.ProjectID] GROUP BY ProjectID;
10. SELECT EmployeeID, COUNT(ProjectID) FROM Project_Employee WHERE EmployeeID = [Project_Employee.EmployeeID] GROUP BY EmployeeID;
```

And these are equivalent placeholders for each SQL template:

1. ["[Company.CompanyID]"]
2. ["[Employee.EmployeeID]"]
3. ["[Project.ProjectID]"]
4. ["[Capability.CapabilityID]"]
5. ["[Project_Employee.EmployeeID]", "[Project_Employee.ProjectID]"]
6. ["[Employee.Location]"]
7. ["[Employee.JobTitle]"]
8. ["[Company_Project.CompanyID]"]
9. ["[Project_Capability.ProjectID]"]
10. ["[Project_Employee.EmployeeID]"]
